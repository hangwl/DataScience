1. Start the server - python server_solution.py
2. Start the client - python client.py

* Server only contains placeholder code and boilerplate for the server (non-machine learning stuff)
* Client requests ads and clicks on them based on data file

As an extension:
* We can also try to implement the epsilon-greedy and UCB-1 algorithm as well
* only the server code will change because "all algorithm interfaces are the same" (only the algorithm itself will change)
