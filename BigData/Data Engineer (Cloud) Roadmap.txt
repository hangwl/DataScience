Data Engineer (Cloud) Roadmap

Python and SQL

python:
for/while loops
if-else statements
functions
object-oriented programming
functional programming
airflow
making request apis
api pagination
focus on being able to write baseline code

sql:
basics
poke on data sets on e.g. Google bigquery
subqueries
views
how to use analytical functions
practice on HackerRank/LeetCode

Data Warehousing and Data Pipelines
read up on concepts
pick one to experiment with: aws, azure, google cloud
be aware of annoying nuances and learn how to interact with these things: 
how to set up an RDS instance, vpns, firewalls to access data

now that i have learnt how to model data, how to write code, we can take all of this and build it on the cloud again, further iterating on my skills 
play around with online apis, take those apis, parse the data pull it out (lambda/mwaa), setup airflow manually on a cloud instance,
take data pull it out and push it to some sort of RDS instance (redshift/snowflake), load that in and start playing with it (build a dashboard off of it in the cloud)

MongoDB and MySQL


Docker and Kubernetes
see docker and kubernetes practical guide

Other things that are good to know


Spark
taming Big Data with python and spark

Linux Commandline

Snowflake Databricks
