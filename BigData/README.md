### BigData Tools
SQL, Hadoop, Hive, and Spark are tools used in the field of big data and data processing.

1. SQL
    SQL is a standard language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. Many big data tools, including Hive and Spark, support SQL-like query languages to enable users to work with data stored in big data systems.

2. Hadoop
    Hadoop is a distributed computing framework that provides a way to store and process large volumes of data across a cluster of machines. Its core components include HDFS and MapReduce. Mainly, Hadoop is designed to handle unstructured data.

3. Hive
    Hive is a data warehousing tool that provides a SQL-like interface for querying and analyzing data stored in Hadoop. Its query language is known as HiveQL.

4. Spark
    Spark is a fast and flexible distributed data processing engine that can be used to process data stored in Hadoop. Its core components include RDDs, DataFrames, and Spark SQL.

### Spark vs Hadoop
Spark is faster and more versatile than Hadoop, with support for real-time processing and a wider range of data processing tasks. However, Hadoop has a more mature ecosystem and is still widely used for batch processing and storage. Their key differences are as follows:

1. Processing Model
    Hadoop MapReduce is a batch processing model, while Spark is designed for both batch and real-time processing. Spark is designed to be faster than Hadoop because it uses in-memory processing and can cache data in memory.

2. Data Processing
    Hadoop processes data in parallel by breaking up large files into smaller chunks and processing them in parallel. Spark processes data in-memory, which allows it to perform iterative operations and complex data processing tasks much faster than Hadoop.

3. APIs and Languages
    Hadoop has a Java-based MapReduce API for processing data, while Spark provides APIs for Java, Scala, Python, and R. Spark has a more expressive API and supports a wider range of data processing tasks.

4. Storage
    Hadoop uses Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for storage, while Spark supports multiple storage systems, including HDFS, Cassandra, and HBase.

5. Fault Tolerance
    Hadoop is designed to handle hardware failures and node failures by replicating data across multiple nodes. Spark also provides fault tolerance but uses a more efficient mechanism called "RDD lineage" to recover lost data.

6. Ecosystem
    Hadoop has a large and mature ecosystem of tools and applications, including Pig, Hive, and HBase. Spark has a smaller ecosystem but is rapidly growing and has already gained popularity for real-time stream processing and machine learning applications.
