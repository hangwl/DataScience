# Machine Learning Use Cases

## Finance
### Algorithmic Trading
* Algorithmic trading requires traders to build mathematical models that can monitor news feeds and trading trends to predict a rise or fall in security prices.
### Fraud Detection
* Finance companies also use machine learning to detect fraudulent activity by comparing transactions against other existing data points. (Out-of-character/Anomaly Detection)
### Portfolio Management
* In portfolio management, robo-advisors built via machine learning provide investors with automated financial advice based on their goals, risk-aversion, and other factors.

## Business
### Chatbots
* Chatbots allow businesses provide faster, more flexible customer service without employing a call center or making customers wait on hold for the next available representative.
### Decision Support
* Business teams will be able to make decisions on resource management or identify trends and problems more quickly.
### Customer Attrition Analysis
* ML can also help businesses deal with customer churn by using data to understand how and why business tend to lose customers.
### Product Recommendation
#### Content-based Filtering 
* Content-based filtering tracks a user's actions then uses this information to create a customer profile. This profile is then compared to the product catalogue to make recommendations.
#### Collaborative Filtering 
* Collaborative filtering methods involve collecting and analysing information on users' behaviours and preferences, and predicting what each user will be based on their similarity to other users. K-NN classification and latent factor analysis (LFM) is most frequently used in collaborative filtering.
#### Complementary Filtering 
* Complementary filtering earns the probability of two or more products being bought together. Essentially, the algorithms are based around recommending products that are complementary to other products, i.e. they are product-defined, as opposed to user-defined, as in content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. The naive-bayes algorithm is most commonly used in complementary filtering.
#### Hybrid Recommendation systems 
* Hybrid recommendation systems work by combining content-based filtering and collaborative filtering methods. 
* This can be achieved by making content-based and collaborative-based predictions separately and then combining them, by adding collaborative-based capabilities to a content-based approach (and vice versa), or by purposefully unifying the two approaches into one model.

## Healthcare
### Improve Administrative Processes
* ML can make these processes more efficient and streamlined, allowing patients to receive personalized medical treatments.
* Medical diagnoses can also become more accurate.
