# Regression Analysis

In regression analysis, we draw a random sample from a population and use it to estimate the properties of that population.
In our regression equation, the coefficients are estimates of the actual population parameters, which we would like to be the best such that they are unbiased and minimize discrepancies between data.

In econometric analysis, OLS estimators are typical. Assuming Gauss-Markov Assumptions hold, OLS estimates are Best Linear Unbiased Estimators (BLUE).
i.e. they are unbiased and efficient

# Gauss-Markov Assumptions:
1. Linearity in parameters
2. Random Sampling
3. No perfect collinearity among covariates
4. Zero conditional Mean (Exogeneity)
5. Homoskedasticity (constant variance) of errors
